# Java-Notes
Java was originally developed by Sun microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995.
It is currently mantained by Oracle Coporatiom.
It was designed to be platform independent meaning Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed.

Basic syntax rules in Java

Java programs are organized into classes and every program must atleast have one class.
Statements in Java are ended with a semicolon
Java  is case sensitive, myVariable and myvariable are two different things.

Variables and Data types

In Java Variables are used to store and manipulate data
Each variable has a specific data type that determines the kind of data it can hold

Here are some common data types in java:

int: used to store whole numbers 
double: used to store decimal numbers
boolean: used to store true or false values
strings: used to store sequence of characters

Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which statements in a program are executed.
Some control flow statements include:

If statements: used to execute a block of code only if the a certain condition is true
For loop: used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a number of times
while loop: used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true

Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)

Java is an object-oriented progr amming language.
Which means it relies heavily on the concept of objects and classes.

Java supports the following principles of OOP

Encapsulation: the act of encapsuling data and methods within a class.
Inheritance: the ability to create new classes based on the existing ones.
Polymophism: the ability to use a single interfase to represent different objects.

Exeption Handling 

Exeption Handling are unexpected events that can occur during the execution of a program.
The try-catch-finally blocks are used to handle exeptions in Java

File Input and Output

File input and output (I/O) operators are useful when dealing with large sets of data
Or when retrieving and storing information from external sources.
Some common classes used for I/O operators in Java include File, Scanner and PrintWriter

Variables and datatypes

Variables are used to store and manipulate data.
A variable is like a container that that holds a value, which can be a number, text or any other type of data.
Before using a variable, it needs to be declared with a specific data type.
